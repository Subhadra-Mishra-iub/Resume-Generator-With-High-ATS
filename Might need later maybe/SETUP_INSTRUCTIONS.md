# 🎯 Complete Local Setup Instructions - ATS Resume Optimizer

## 📁 Step 1: Create Folder Structure

Create this exact folder structure on your laptop:

```
resume-optimizer/
├── resume_optimizer.py          # Main script (I'll provide)
├── requirements.txt             # Dependencies  
├── README.md                    # Instructions
└── src/                         # Your LaTeX resume files
    ├── heading.tex
    ├── education.tex
    ├── skills.tex
    ├── experience.tex
    ├── projects.tex
    └── Hackathon-Experience.tex (optional)
```

## 📋 Step 2: Copy Your LaTeX Files

Copy your existing LaTeX files to the `src/` folder:
- From your attachments, copy heading.tex, education.tex, etc.
- Keep them exactly as they are - the system will optimize them

## ⚡ Step 3: Install Dependencies

Open terminal/command prompt in the resume-optimizer folder and run:

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install nltk streamlit

# Download language data (one-time setup)
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"
```
